# GIS AI Agent Examples

Welcome to the GIS AI Agent examples section! Here you'll find step-by-step tutorials for building AI agents that can perform geospatial operations using the GIS MCP Server.

## Overview

These tutorials will guide you through creating your own AI agents that can:

- Calculate distances between points
- Transform coordinates between different systems
- Create buffers around locations
- Perform spatial analysis
- And much more!

## Available Agent Examples

### 1. Langchain (Python)

Build a GIS AI agent using LangChain and Python. This tutorial is perfect for Python developers who want to integrate geospatial capabilities into their AI applications.

**[→ Get Started with Langchain Agent](langchain.md)**

- ✅ Python-based agent framework
- ✅ Integrate with OpenRouter to access multiple AI models
- ✅ Step-by-step tutorial from zero to hero
- ✅ No prior AI or GIS experience needed

### 2. OpenAI (NodeJs)

Build a GIS AI agent using OpenAI's Agent SDK in Node.js. This tutorial is perfect for JavaScript/TypeScript developers who want to build GIS agents.

**[→ Get Started with OpenAI-Nodejs Agent](openai-nodejs.md)**

- ✅ Node.js-based agent framework
- ✅ Uses OpenAI's Agent SDK
- ✅ Step-by-step tutorial with clear instructions
- ✅ Perfect for JavaScript/TypeScript developers

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **Python 3.10 or higher** (for Langchain agent) or **Node.js v24.11.1 or higher** (for OpenAI-Nodejs agent)
- **GIS MCP Server** installed and running
- **A code editor** (VS Code, PyCharm, or any text editor)
- **An internet connection** for installing packages
- **Basic command line knowledge**

## Getting Started

1. Choose the agent framework that matches your preferred programming language
2. Follow the step-by-step tutorial for your chosen framework
3. Start building amazing geospatial AI applications!
